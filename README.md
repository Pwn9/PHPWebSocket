PHPWebSocket based on: https://code.google.com/p/phpwebsocket/

Basically this project is just to remind me that I want to do a project with PHP websockets, and unless I have 
something up somewhere as a constant reminder that this is a project I want to work on, I will probably forget 
to work on it.

Eventually the goal is to expand upon the websocket class created here first by making it work for the updated 
standards, and then by making it into an even easier to use framework websocket for PHP without the complexity 
of setting up something like Ratchet.


The "BetterPHPWebSocket" is code I found somewhere, trying to locate attribution for it.. this just feels like 
better code, handshaking works better, messages work better, it uses JSON and has multi-user already built-in 
such that, I think moving forward I will be a new class based on this example.
